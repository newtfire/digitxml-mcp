## DigitAI XML-MCP 

This is an experiment to make a specialized small-scale local AI agent to be an MCP client, 
addressing an MCP system that makes sophisticated use of XML parsing tools with saxonche and SaxonHE.
The purpose of the DigitAI XML-MCP system is to work on XML-based projects, deploy XPath and XQuery to help identify project inconsistencies, and run XSLT transformations to  patch and improve projects locally. 

### Stage 1
Build this with Claude Desktop as the local language model + MCP client. 
Construct the MCP server and begin testing with local XML projects, Relax NG schemas, including ODD-generated schemas + Schematron. 

* install [Claude for Desktop](https://claude.com/download) (available for Mac, Windows, and Windows (ARM 64).
